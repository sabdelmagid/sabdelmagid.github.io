I am a postdoctoral scholar in Computer Science at Princeton University, working with [Dr. Olga Russakovsky](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/) in the [Princeton Visual AI Lab](https://visualai.princeton.edu/). My research interests are broad and interdisciplinary, spanning vision-language models, test-time adaptation, fairness, and the social impact of these models. I‚Äôm always excited to collaborate across disciplines‚Äîplease feel free to reach out!

\\
I completed my Ph.D. at Harvard University under the supervision of Dr. Hanspeter Pfister in the Harvard Visual Computing Group. I received the Siebel Scholarship and Harvard University Graduate Prize Fellowship. Previously, I have interned with Adobe Research and earned my B.S. and M.S. from Santa Clara University, where I was advised by Dr. Behnam Dezfouli in the Internet of Things Research Lab.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
